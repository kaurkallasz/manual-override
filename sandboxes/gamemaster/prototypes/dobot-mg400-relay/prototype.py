"""
Dobot MG400 Relay — two-arm game-master relay server (a Flask blueprint).

This machine OWNS TWO MG400 connections — one per side ("purple" / "green") — and
relays each side's move/pump commands to ITS OWN arm. The two sides are fully
INDEPENDENT and drive concurrently: purple's controller drives the purple arm
while green's controller drives the green arm, with no blocking between sides.

Both arms keep Dobot's factory IP (192.168.1.6) and are told apart by which
LOCAL NETWORK INTERFACE each side's sockets are pinned to (macOS IP_BOUND_IF —
see relay_arm.py and the dualdobottest proof of concept).

Per SIDE the relay still arbitrates: a side must *acquire* its arm and gets an
opaque token + a lease; a per-side watchdog smooth-stops that side's arm if its
holder stops heartbeating. This stops two tabs of the SAME side from fighting,
but it NEVER blocks across sides.

Every command for a side passes the same safety filter (joint limits / reachable
workspace clamp mirrored from the joint and cartesian prototypes) before it
reaches that side's arm.

A single GLOBAL E-STOP latch stops BOTH arms; `clear` un-latches it and clears
both arms' errors.

Loaded by hub.py; registered under /p/dobot-mg400-relay. No app.run() of its own —
it only runs inside the hub server. It needs each arm reachable on the network to
move it; without a robot the operator GUI + every endpoint still work and
move/pump fail cleanly with "Not connected".

Put each robot in API mode first — see ../../docs/operations/dobot-api-mode.md.
Safety: keep the hardware E-stop within reach; start with a low speed.
